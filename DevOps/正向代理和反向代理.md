## 正向代理 forward proxy：

A forward proxy stands in for the client -- on behalf of the client for making requests to the internet or other networks.

This acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. When you send a request, the forward proxy takes this request and makes it on behalf of you. 

网站并没有把你的客户端认定为请求的来源，而是把代理服务器(forward proxy)视作请求的来源。

benefits
- privacy (the website doesn't get your IP address) 
- circumventing geo-restrictions (the website sees the IP address of the proxy, which could be in a different country).

## 反向代理 reverse proxy:

a reverse proxy stands in for the server -- receives client requests and forwards them to the appropriate web server on behalf of that server. 

When a client sends a request to a server, the reverse proxy intercepts this request and decides where to send it among a pool of servers. 

客户端认为它是直接与服务器进行通信，但实际上它是在与代理服务器(reverse proxy)进行通信。

benefits: 
- load balancing (distributing requests to prevent any single server from getting overloaded)
- increased security (the client doesn't get direct access to the servers).
