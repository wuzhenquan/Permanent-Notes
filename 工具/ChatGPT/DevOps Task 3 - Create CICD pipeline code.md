这里再说明一下 pipline，其流程是这样的

Build ➡️ Text ➡️ Push to repo ➡️ Deploy


> now write a jerkinsfile for the complete CI/CD pipeline for the above nodejs application, including deployment to k8s cluster

结果发现有些东西缺失了，例如

- "docker login" is missing
- Is not applying the deployment and service file

> now adjust the jenkinsfile to have 1 stage for building and pushing the docker image and logging in to the dockerHub private repository. In the final stage, apply deployment and service files to the k8s cluster, but keep the KUBE_CONFIG parameter

发现结果并不是我想要的

> Keep the build and test stages as they were intially, but create a separate stage for building a docker image and pushing to docker repository, but before pushing image, make sure to log in to the docker repository first

结果有以下缺失

- missing the "deploy" stage completely
- 变量名不对

> add deploy to kubernetes stage as in the previous example. Also read the DOCK_HUB_USERNAME as a credential, just like the DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD, but call them DOCKER_USER and DOCKER_PWD respectively and also use the credentials function instead of withCredentials to read both of these values

接下来我们想要再添加一个 stage：Notify about build status via Slack

> add a stage to notify team through slack channel about the status

发现一个问题

- Failure notifications is missing

> slack notification should be sent either for failure or success and should always execute after the build is finished as the last step

如果看上去还没答完，可以说

> continue with your response

接下来我想要 Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file

> give me a Gitlab CI equipvalent of this jerkinsfile: 然后贴上 jerkinsfile 代码
