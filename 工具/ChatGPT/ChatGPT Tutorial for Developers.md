## Python Examples

## Generating Python Code

> Write a python function for generating a random password

然后如果对其中的代码有些不懂，可以继续问

## Asking Computer Science Questions

> What is the time complexity of this function?

接上面写这个函数的单元测试

> Write unit tests for this function

## Improving Code

🤩🤩🤩

> How can I improve this code? 然后按 shift+enter 换行，然后粘贴要优化的代码

## Translating Code

> Convert this Python code to JavaScript. 然后按 shift+enter 换行，然后粘贴要优化的代码

## Generating Dummy Data

> Generate dummy data for a table called customers. Each customer should have an ID, first name, last name and city.

如果想要换个语言

> I don’t need a Python script. Just give me the data.

想要这些数据的工厂类的话

> Create a Python class for storing these objects.

继续问

> De

# Node.js Examples

> I need an API built with Express.js to return the list of products. Each product should have attributes like ID, title, description, price and imageURL

接下来我想把数据存在 MongoDB 里

> Modify the code and retrieve the products from a MongoDB database.

接下来我想转成 TypeScript

> Use TypeScript in this code.

接下来我想转成 Python

> Generate this API using Python and FastAPI.

------

# SQL Examples

> Write a SQL query to generate a table called products with 4 columns.

如果示例代码的 name 和 type 不是我想要的，接下来我可以说

> Write a SQL query to generate a table called products with these columns: id (int) category: string unitPrice: int unitPrice: float imageUrl: string

> Write a query to retrieve the top 5 customers in Manhattan.

这结果好像是按 id 降序排序的，不是我们想要的按消费了多少钱排序的，接下来我们可以

> Revise this query and join the customers table with the orders table to find out how much each customer has spent. Then pick the top 5 who have spent the most.
